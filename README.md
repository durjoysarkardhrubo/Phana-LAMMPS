# Phonon_Dispersion_Curves

This repository contains scripts and data for generating phonon dispersion curves using the Phana package in LAMMPS.

## Description

The `pdisp.dat` file includes the necessary commands for creating phonon dispersion curves. The phonon dispersion paths covered are:
- Gamma to M
- M to K
- K to Gamma

The generated curves are uploaded for visualization and further analysis.
